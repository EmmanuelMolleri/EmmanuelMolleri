### :coffee: Hello, would you like some coffee? 

### *Hello World:* 

I work on developing projects and courses that involve data preprocessing on cross plataform applications, implementation of API's and services to maintain apps working. To do that I specialized myself in C# and javasrcipt, using C# for back-end services and javasript on front-end apps
I'm a problem solver but also a analyst, every software must be analyzed to check it scalability to deliver the best tool to work with. 

### *Skills:*:receipt:

**Programing:** C#/.Net, .Net MAUI, Javascript/Typescript. 

**Coding knowledge:** Hexagonal architecture, clean code, generic types, distributed cache, message queueing, SOLID, services, lambdas, API's, console apps, mobile, desktop, web, TDD and DDD.

**Databases:** Mysql, mssql, oracle, mongo and dynamoDB.

**DevOps:** Azure devops, azure pipelines and repository.

**Infraestructure:** AKS, AWS, Azure ServiceBus, Sonar Qube, Jenkins, kubernets, docker, Azure CI/CD.

**Analysis**: Code analysis, elastisearch with kibana, AWS logs insights and cloudwatch.

### *Experience:*:rocket:
- API's to comunicate with applications
- API's to comunicate with other API's
- Windows services
- CronJob's
- Mobile applications
- WebHooks
- real time application monitoring or functionalities 
- MVC applications
- Web Apps
- Application tests

### *My best professional experiences:*
- I've worked on API services, not just integrations but on server side applications with services (microservices).
  - *use case:* We had an app that had the same backend for web and mobile and desktop applications, we needed to track information, data and some negociations. 
  - In these API's I use to work with a database (or consuming data from other API's, using gateway patterns on the infraestructure layer to do so).
  - I can log anything in non relational databases or in AWS logs insights (NLog).
  - To keep a quality between clean code and SOLID I used MediaTr (mediator pattern).
  - These API's I've worked on had unit tests that I do to keep a code quality.
- Sometimes our clients require on real time updates like messages, texting, status or even location
  - *use case:* we had a demand where our client needed not just chat with the driver, but track his location as well.
  - For that I used on my projects tools like SignalR (that allows me to send messages to other apps and keep messages, status or anything on real time like a websocket).
  - To comunicate API to API comunication I like to use Webhooks (to send information to third party companies).
  - Integrations I use API endpoint comunication with batch entries (to update documentation of the truck, driver and load).
- I used services on my personal experience to deal with jobs that should be executed from time to time (that are not a priority, but they need to be done sometimes a day)
  - *use case:* I had a demand where our client needed to send to government our invoices, employees documentation, etc...
  - we created a cloud service that would execute twice a day, sending and recieving invoice status and sending documents.
  - we needed a file sever to work with documentation, so to store documents and manage anything that the client needed to keep it.
- When a payload is too much to handle I used message queue
  - *use case:* I had a task on sprint to handle a batch of products that would overload the system (and a series of tasks to do to each product, not just validation, but notifications, adding to specific stores on relational databases and configure the products on the system).
  - We created a message queue to our providers populate them on Azure Service Bus.
  - We consumed 10 messages per iteration (each message could contain more than a 1000 products).
  - Foreach message and its products we had to make a lot of tasks to integrate them on our systems.
